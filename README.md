# Umami Analytics Plugin

The **Umami Analytics** Plugin is an extension for [Grav CMS](https://github.com/getgrav/grav) for adding Umami Analytics to your site

## Installation

Installing the Umami Analytics plugin can be done in one of three ways: The GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation method lets you quickly install the plugin with a simple terminal command, the manual method lets you do so via a zip file, and the admin method lets you do so via the Admin Plugin.

### GPM Installation (Preferred)

To install the plugin via the [GPM](https://learn.getgrav.org/cli-console/grav-cli-gpm), through your system's terminal (also called the command line), navigate to the root of your Grav-installation, and enter:

    bin/gpm install umami-analytics

This will install the Umami Analytics plugin into your `/user/plugins`-directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins/umami-analytics`.

### Manual Installation

To install the plugin manually, download the zip-version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins`. Then rename the folder to `umami-analytics`. You can find these files on [GitHub](https://github.com/crabston/grav-plugin-umami-analytics) or via [GetGrav.org](https://getgrav.org/downloads/plugins).

You should now have all the plugin files under

    /your/site/grav/user/plugins/umami-analytics
	
### Admin Plugin

If you use the Admin Plugin, you can install the plugin directly by browsing the `Plugins`-menu and clicking on the `Add` button.

## Configuration

Before configuring this plugin, you should copy the `user/plugins/umami-analytics/umami-analytics.yaml` to `user/config/plugins/umami-analytics.yaml` and only edit that copy.

Here is the default configuration and an explanation of available options:

```yaml
enabled: true
```

Note that if you use the Admin Plugin, a file with your configuration named umami-analytics.yaml will be saved in the `user/config/plugins/`-folder once the configuration is saved in the Admin.

## Usage

The plugin will inject the Umami Analytics script into your site's `<head>` tag. You can verify this by inspecting the source code of your site.

After you've added your website to Umami, you have to set the `server_url` and the `website_id` fields in the plugin configuration. You can find these values in the Umami dashboard.

- `server_url` is the URL of your Umami server, e.g. `https://us.umami.is`.
- `website_id` is the ID of your website, e.g. `76e4f3db-8fec-47ad-82ba-f5O21cOac915`.
